function y = c_shift(x, n)% >> y = c_shift(x, n). A function which moves the last n components of % the vector x into the first n component places and shifts the remaining% components of x to follow those n components, i.e. this is a circular % shift. It can be used to prevent a periodic function, as found in FFT % analyses, from being split into the first and last parts of the window % in which it is displayed.  Note: x must be a row vector.len= length(x);y = [x(len-n+1 : end), x(1:len-n)];
